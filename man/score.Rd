\title{Score circumplex scales from item responses}
\usage{
score(.data, items, instrument, na.rm = TRUE, prefix = "", suffix = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Required. A data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{items}{Required. The variable names or column numbers for the
variables in \code{.data} that contain all the circumplex items from a
single circumplex measure, in ascending order from item 1 to item N.}

\item{instrument}{Required. An instrument object from the package. To see
the available circumplex instruments, use \code{instruments()}.}

\item{na.rm}{Optional. A logical that determines if missing values should be
omitted from the calculation of scores (default = TRUE). When set to TRUE,
scales with missing data are essentially calculated with mean imputation.}

\item{prefix}{Optional. A string to include at the beginning of the newly
calculated scale variables' names, before \code{Abbrev} from \code{key}
and \code{suffix} (default = "").}

\item{suffix}{Optional. A string to include at the end of the newly
calculated scale variables' names, after \code{Abbrev} from \code{key}
and \code{prefix} (default = "").}
}
\value{
A data frame that matches \code{.data} except that new variables are
appended that contain mean scores on each variable included in \code{key}.
}
\description{
Calculate mean scores on circumplex scales from item responses by using a
set of scoring instructions, which may be loaded from the package or created
as a custom data frame.

\examples{
data("raw_iipsc")
instrument("iipsc")
score(raw_iipsc, IIP01:IIP32, iipsc)
