Instrument-related Tidying Functions","what":"Standardizing scale-level data","title":"Using Circumplex Instruments","text":"Finally, can often helpful transform scale-level data reference normative comparison sample. often called “standardizing” involves subtracting normative sample’s mean score scale participant’s score scale dividing difference normative sample’s standard deviation. rescales scale scores standard deviation units describe magnitude participant’s difference normative average. many circumplex instruments, data needed perform standardization included instrument object. instruments even multiple (e.g., different overlapping) normative samples comparisons matched terms gender, age, nationality. selecting normative sample compare , important consider size appropriateness sample. demonstrate, let’s examine normative data sets available IIP-SC. see two options: rather large sample American college students rather small sample American psychiatric outpatients. Assuming example data also come non-psychiatric community sample mostly college students, first normative sample seems like better choice, especially since much larger therefore subject less sampling error. However, may times second normative sample appropriate comparison, even despite smaller sample. transform scale scores calculated last section, can call standardize() function give scale_scores object saved item-level scale-level data within. save output function data frame named z_scales reflect idea standardized scores often called “z-scores.” , output contains item-level, scale-level, now standardized scale-level variables. new variables named scale score variables except configurable prefix suffix (default, given suffix _z). can use select() function view just newly created standardized variables. variables ones likely use subsequent analyses (e.g., structural summary method).","code":"norms(iipsc) #> The IIP-SC currently has 2 normative data set(s): #> 1. 872 American college students #> Hopwood, Pincus, DeMoor, & Koonce (2011) #> <https://doi.org/10.1080/00223890802388665> #> 2. 106 American psychiatric outpatients #> Soldz, Budman, Demby, & Merry (1995) #> <https://doi.org/10.1177/1073191195002001006> z_scales <- standardize(   .data = scale_scores,    scales = PA:NO,    angles = octants(),   instrument = iipsc,   sample = 1 ) print(z_scales) #> # A tibble: 10 × 48 #>    IIP01 IIP02 IIP03 IIP04 IIP05 IIP06 IIP07 IIP08 IIP09 IIP10 IIP11 IIP12 IIP13 #>    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> #>  1     0     0     0     0     1     0     1     0     2     1     0     0     0 #>  2     1     1     0     0     3     2     2     1     0     1     0     1     4 #>  3     1     0     1     0     1     1     1     3     0     1     0     0     2 #>  4     3     2     3    NA     2     3     2     3     2     3     2     4     2 #>  5     0     0     0     1     0     0     1     1     0     1     0     2     1 #>  6     0     0     0     0     0     0     1     1     0     0     0     0     0 #>  7     1     0     0     0     2     1     1     0     1     0     0     0     1 #>  8     1     0     1     0     1     1     2     1     1     0     0     0     1 #>  9     0     0     2     2     0     1     3     0     1     0     1     1     0 #> 10     0     0     0     0     0     0     2     0     0     0     0     0     0 #> # … with 35 more variables: IIP14 <dbl>, IIP15 <dbl>, IIP16 <dbl>, IIP17 <dbl>, #> #   IIP18 <dbl>, IIP19 <dbl>, IIP20 <dbl>, IIP21 <dbl>, IIP22 <dbl>, #> #   IIP23 <dbl>, IIP24 <dbl>, IIP25 <dbl>, IIP26 <dbl>, IIP27 <dbl>, #> #   IIP28 <dbl>, IIP29 <dbl>, IIP30 <dbl>, IIP31 <dbl>, IIP32 <dbl>, PA <dbl>, #> #   BC <dbl>, DE <dbl>, FG <dbl>, HI <dbl>, JK <dbl>, LM <dbl>, NO <dbl>, #> #   PA_z <dbl>, BC_z <dbl>, DE_z <dbl>, FG_z <dbl>, HI_z <dbl>, JK_z <dbl>, #> #   LM_z <dbl>, NO_z <dbl> select(z_scales, PA_z:NO_z) #> # A tibble: 10 × 8 #>       PA_z    BC_z   DE_z    FG_z   HI_z   JK_z    LM_z    NO_z #>      <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> #>  1  1.5     1.75    0.409 -1.11   -1.01  -1.33   0.0424 -0.344  #>  2 -0.773  -0.424  -0.760 -0.578   0.634  0.428 -0.261  -0.0312 #>  3  0.364  -0.0616 -0.175 -1.11    0.907  0.721  1.25    1.22   #>  4  1.5     2.11    1.87   1.36    1.18   0.721  1.25    1.84   #>  5 -0.394  -0.0616 -1.05  -0.0501 -1.01  -1.33  -0.261  -0.344  #>  6 -0.773  -1.15   -1.05  -1.11   -1.55  -1.62  -0.564  -0.0312 #>  7  0.364  -1.15   -1.05  -1.11   -0.459 -0.452 -0.867  -0.969  #>  8  0.364  -0.786  -0.175 -1.11   -1.01  -0.843  0.345  -0.0312 #>  9 -0.0152 -0.424   0.702 -0.314  -1.55  -0.452  1.56   -0.656  #> 10 -1.15   -1.15   -1.05  -1.11   -1.55  -1.04  -0.564  -0.969"},{"path":"http://circumplex.jmgirard.com/articles/using-instruments.html","id":"wrap-up","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"4.
